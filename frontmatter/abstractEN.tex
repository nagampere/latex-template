This study examines the effects of social capital investment on regional economic performance using empirical data from various regions. Social capital investment, encompassing infrastructure development, public services, and community support systems, is a key driver of regional economic growth and sustainability. Through statistical analysis and econometric modeling, this research identifies the direct and indirect impacts of such investments on GDP growth, employment rates, and income distribution across regions. The findings highlight the importance of strategic allocation of resources to maximize economic returns and address regional disparities. Policy implications for sustainable and inclusive growth are also discussed.
